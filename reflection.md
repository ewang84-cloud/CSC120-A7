- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    I feel like it really makes sense, the only thing that I need to keep an eye on is the constructor, but logically it's very smooth so not hard to understand
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Everything worked pretty while once starting it
